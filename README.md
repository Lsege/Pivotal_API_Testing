# Pivotal Tracker API Testing Framework

We designed a robust API testing framework using Python, pytest BDD, Selenium, and Gherkin to ensure the reliability and functionality of the Pivotal Tracker application. This comprehensive framework covers key functionalities, providing thorough testing and validation. With its powerful combination of technologies, the framework streamlines testing processes, enhancing the quality and stability of the Pivotal Tracker platform.


## Introduction

The Pivotal Tracker API Testing Framework is designed to simplify and streamline the process of testing the Pivotal Tracker API. It provides a set of reusable test cases and utilities that can be easily integrated into your test automation workflow.

## Features

- Easy setup and configuration
- Reusable test cases for API endpoints
- Support for different authentication methods (e.g., API key, OAuth)
- Assertions for validating API responses
- Test data management and generation utilities
- Integration with popular testing frameworks (e.g., Postman, Newman)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Pivotal Tracker API Testing Framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pivotal-tracker-api-testing.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the framework according to your API environment (e.g., base URL, authentication credentials)
4. Run the sample test cases: `npm test`
5. Customize and extend the framework to suit your specific testing needs.

For detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and usage, please refer to the [documentation](docs/).

## Test Cases

The framework provides a comprehensive set of test cases covering various API endpoints and scenarios. These test cases can serve as a starting point for your API testing efforts and can be easily customized or extended to match your specific requirements.

For more information on the available test cases and how to create your own, please refer to the [test case documentation](docs/test-cases.md).

## Data Management

Managing test data is an essential part of API testing. The framework offers utilities for handling test data, including generating random data, storing and retrieving data from external sources, and manipulating data for specific test scenarios. These utilities aim to simplify the process of test data management and make it easier to create comprehensive and meaningful test scenarios.

To learn more about the data management utilities provided by the framework, please refer to the [data management documentation](docs/data-management.md).
